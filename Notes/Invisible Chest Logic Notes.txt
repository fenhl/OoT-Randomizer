Deku
	Burn web with torch by standing on chest

DC
	Longshot bomb bag chest to reach platform

Forest
	courtyard island for both chest and skulltula

MQ Forest
	longshot in courtyard to reach ledge

MQ Fire
	Added note about spin attack for fairy pot by boss key chest
	Added either hammering the switch or using pixelshot with longshot to reach the skulltula in the fire ring (scarecrow area in vanilla)

Shadow
	logic_shadow_umbrella_gs
	Stand on chest for hookshot
	Didn't add to shadow temple wind tunnel exit because it has a lens of truth requirement, but feel like maybe it should have this anyway since that requirement doesn't really apply to standing on the chest itself?

Spirit
	longshot to child hand is fine because that part is included in the chest requirements itself, not an exit.

Ganon's
	Shadow trial clear with longshot
