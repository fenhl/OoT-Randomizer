This file documents parts of the OoT save data that go unused in vanilla but are used by the randomizer. **It may be incomplete.**

# Ammo counts

The ammunition count fields for fire arrows (save context + 0x90) and Din's Fire (save context + 0x91) are repurposed as a single unsigned 16-bit integer field representing the number of items received from the network in a multiworld seed.

# Scene flags

## Unused field

The unused field (offset 0x10) of the permanent scene flags (save context + 0xd4 + 0x1c * scene ID) is used for the following purposes:

* Total small key count: Scenes 0x00–0x10
    * Each dungeon uses the upper halfword of its own unused field.
    * 0x00-0x0F Dungeons
    * 0x10 Treasure Box Shop
* Scrub Shuffle: Scenes 0x00–0x27, 0x5B, 0x61
    * Scrubs in grottos store their “sold out” flag in the scene corresponding to the grotto content ID minus 0xD6, and other scrubs store it in their own scene.
    * Each scrub uses [the item it sells in vanilla](https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Actor_List_(Variables)#En_Shopnuts) as a bit mask. These are all in the lower halfword, so there is no collision with total small key count.

With `shuffle_beans`, `shuffle_expensive_merchants`, or `shuffle_tcgkeys`, flags for the bean salesman or Medigoron and the carpet salesman, respectively, are similarly stored in collectibles fields:

* Chest Mini Game: scene 0x10, bit 0000_0002

# inf_table

Additional flags stored in `inf_table` (an array of 16-bit integers at save context + 0x0ef8):

* Entry 0x1b, bit 0002 is set when the Temple of Time altar is read as child. This allows the pause menu dungeon info to display stone locations depending on settings.
* Entry 0x1b, bit 0001 is set when the Temple of Time altar is read as adult. This allows the pause menu dungeon info to display medallion locations depending on settings.

# Misc data

Current mask: 1 byte at save context + 0x3B. Written on `Player_Destroy`. Read on `Player_Init` except when moving through time.
